This is a basic program similar to COMP102's miniPaint. You can draw lines and ovals.
The lines are drawn point-to-point. You can add as many points as you want by clicking.
To stop drawing the line, click twice in the same place.
You click and drag to draw ovals.
Each point/oval is added to a .txt file that the SCARA program can read.
